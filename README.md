# Polynomial Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Polynomial Regression using Python and scikit-learn. Polynomial Regression is a type of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (in this case, "Position Level") and the dependent variable (in this case, "Salary") is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, you should have the following installed:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using `pip` or `conda`.

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```
## Project Overview
In this project, we perform the following tasks:

- Import necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- Import a dataset (in this case, 'Position_Salaries.csv') for training and testing.
- Train a Linear Regression model on the dataset.
- Train a Polynomial Regression model on the dataset.
- Visualize the results of both Linear and Polynomial Regression models.
- Make predictions using the trained models.
- Project Structure
## The project is structured as follows:

Polynomial_Regression.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and explanations.
Position_Salaries.csv: The dataset used for training and testing.
## Getting Started
1) Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmad1015/Polynomial-Regression-in-Python.git
  ``
2) Navigate to the project directory:
``` bash
cd polynomial-regression-in-Python
```
3) Run the Jupyter Notebook polynomial_regression.ipynb to see the code and results.
## Usage
You can use this project as a starting point for understanding and implementing Polynomial Regression in your own projects. Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific needs.

## Results
The project includes visualizations of the Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models' predictions on the 'Position_Salaries.csv' dataset. You can analyze these results to understand how well each model fits the data.
